Nokia was closed the server and not allowed public access.

NaviFirmEx won't work anymore!!!

I don't have the time to maintain this project anymore, sorry.


# NaviFirmEx #

NaviFirmEx is the tool for downloading Nokia firmware images, obtaining lists of product codes, and finding the right product code for your phone. All these images is straight from Nokia's servers so you don't have to wait for people to post data packages and lists of product codes.

NaviFirmEx is useful for just about anyone:

**End users**: Find product codes to use with NSS/NSU/

**Developers/DIYERs**: Download ROM images for extracting files

**Care Suite/Phoenix/box users**: Download ROM images to flash
